## Warcraft 3 Replay Parser in Go

Work in progress. Currently only pulls out metadata, not the actual game events. 

Supports all versions of the game, including Reforged.

Based on http://w3g.deepnode.de/files/w3g_format.txt, with my own research into the Reforged format (e.g. Battle.net 2.0 integration).
